# bitx-java
This is a Java wrapper for [Luno API](https://www.luno.com/api).

## Implementation

The implementation follows the same pattern as used for the [Spring Social Twitter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-twitter).

It currently only supports the public part Luni API. 

## Build

To check out the project and build from source, do the following:

     git clone https://github.com/czietsman/bitx-java.git
     cd bitx-java
     ./gradlew build
     
     
## Todo

Volunteers are welcome to contribute. Here are some suggestions:

 * Add support for non-public Luno API
 * Add Spring Boot auto configuration
 * Publish to Maven Central
 * Build with Travis CI
 * Add documentation
